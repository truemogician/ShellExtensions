The compound file, stand-alone, and NTFS file system implementations of IPropertySetStorage similarly do not support transacted, simple property sets because these property sets are stored in streams. However, transactioning of nonsimple property sets, which can be created by specifying the PROPSETFLAG_NONSIMPLE flag in the grfFlags parameter of IPropertySetStorage::Create, are supported.
