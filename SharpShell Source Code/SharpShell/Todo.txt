  - File Class

Property Sheet
==============

Icon Handler
============

DONE: Create an example icon handler that shows whether an assembly is managed or not.
DONE: Set DefaultIcon to %1 when registering an icon handler server.
DONE: Store the old DefaultIcon in the registry class when changing to %1 so
  that it can be restored on unregistration. Currently there are permission issues.
* Seems like when the icon handler is used multiple times in the same parent folder, icons
  are not correct - may be a sharing issue.

Server Manager
==============

DONE: Support Icon Handler tests, calling the one key function and having a dummy shell.
* Support Property Sheet tests, calling the two key functions and having a dummy shell.
* Allow Enable/Disable event log.
* Allow Quick View of event log.
* Show testing context menu items in bold, only test associated items.

Unit Tests
==========

* It would be entirely possible to test the server registration manager with unit tests - 
however, they would really be integration tests as they'd have to be run on different 
operating systems with different processor architectures.
